southHGUs.dat, centralHGUs.dat, and northHGUs.dat are outputs from an ATS run of the model created of Shambley Creek. All fluxes are in mol/h, masses in mol, and depths in height. Time (1st column) is in seconds after Jan 1, 2016, 
these files can be loaded into Jupyter notebook to produce Figures 2-5 of the manuscript "Storage, Connectivity, and Stream Drying in Headwater Systems: Modeling Across Hydrogeomorphic Features"

Additional raw data, extracted from ATS surface visulaization files is contained within the percentflowing.csv

Input files for the ATS model are Shambley2025.xml and an exodus II mesh file.
